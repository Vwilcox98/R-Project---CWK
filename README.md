# R-Project---CWK

This goal of this project is do an analysis of Enterococcus in Charleston waterways to see if there is any link between the locations of sampling and the results. 

All of my code is in the “Scripts” folder.
All figures are in the "figs" folder.
Running the code shows different plots that show the overall results of the data.

Gathering Data:
The data can be found on the Charleston Waterkeeper's website, then it needs to be converted to a more readable and user friendly format, or just use the CWKCumulative2.csv file that I have uploaded.

Explaining the Data:
The columns are as follows: "Station", which is the location of which each sample was taken, "Latitude", which is the latitude of that station, "Longitude", which is the longitude of that station, "Date", which is the date the sample was collected, "Time", which was the time the sample was collected, "Parameter", which is the bacteria being enumerated which is Enterococci, "Result", which is the number of Enterococci found within 100 mL of sample, "Units", which is the most probable number of Enterococci per 100 mL of sample, "Rainfall in Last 24 hours", which is the inches of rain in the 24 hours prior to collecting the sample, "Tide Stage", which describes whether the tide is high or low or between, "Weather", which describes the weather at the time of collection, and "Wind/Current Direction", which describes which way the wind was blowing at the time of collection.
