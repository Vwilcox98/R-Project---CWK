# R-Project---CWK

This goal of this project is do an analysis of Enterococcus in Charleston waterways to see if there is any link between the locations of sampling and the results. 

All of my code is in the “Scripts” folder.
Running the code shows different plots that show the overall results of the data.

Gathering Data:
The data can be found on the Charleston Waterkeeper's website, then it needs to be converted to a more readable and user friendly format, or just use the CWKCumulative2.csv file that I have uploaded.


Acknowledgements: The Charleston Waterkeepers sent me their databases directly to help me with this project and Dr. McGlinn for being patient and helping me move forward.
